# Lil' Func #

A little library for functional programming in JavaScript. These are just examples for a blog post to demonstrate basic FP concepts. I don't recommend this for production use. Instead try [Underscore.js](http://underscorejs.org/), [Lo-Dash](http://lodash.com/), [fn.js](http://eliperelman.com/fn.js/), etc.
